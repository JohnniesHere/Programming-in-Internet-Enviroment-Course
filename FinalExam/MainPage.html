            <p>Chuck Norris is an American martial artist, actor, film producer, and screenwriter who became a global action star.
                After serving in the United States Air Force, he won many martial arts championships and later founded his own discipline Chun Kuk Do.
                Norris is a black belt in Tang Soo Do, Brazilian jiu jitsu and Judo, and won numerous karate championships throughout the 1960s.
                He appeared in a number of action films, such as Way of the Dragon alongside Bruce Lee, Missing in Action, and The Delta Force.
                He gained widespread fame playing the leading role in the television series Walker, Texas Ranger from 1993 to 2001,
                which ran for eight successful seasons. Beyond his entertainment career,
                Norris has dedicated much of his life to martial arts education and has helped create multiple charitable organizations,
                including Kickstart Kids, which teaches martial arts to middle school students to promote discipline and respect.
                He has also authored several books and become a popular internet culture icon,
                known for humorous "Chuck Norris facts" that exaggerate his toughness and abilities.</p>
